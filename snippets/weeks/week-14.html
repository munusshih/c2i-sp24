                <p class="space--after-single">Hooray! We’re one week away from the end of the semester. Before we celebrate, give some love to your class homepage, which has been serving as an index of all of the work you produced throughout the semester. Make sure that your projects and exercises from both the Studio and Lab section are linked out. So far, your website should have HTML, CSS, and should be responsive. Now add a bit of JavaScript to it — up to you what that could be! Your class homepage is your coding playground.</p>
